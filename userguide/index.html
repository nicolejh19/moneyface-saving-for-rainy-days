        <h3 id="aboutus">About Us</h3>
        <p> 
          Check out the bot at : <a href = "https://t.me/SavingforRainyDaysBot"> Saving for Rainy Days </a>
          <br>We are Team MoneyFace and we created this simple web page with the intention to allow for a more detailed explanation of the features in Saving for Rainy Days as the content may be too wordy on Telegram. (<i>you see this sentence is so wordy</i>) 🤪
          Don't be too surprised if our bot sounds too casual because it was created by two aunties. 👵👵

	    <p> 
		Don't panic! 🤣 As we are running a free account on PythonAnywhere, the server sleeps when you are inactive for long. Simply head back to the main menu by calling /main and the bot will be resurrected! 🤗
		    If that doesn't work, then the bot is <b>REALLY</b> dead! 😬 (but I doubt it ever will since we maintain quite well)

        <h3 id="savings">Manage Savings</h3>
        <p>
          At the start of each month, you will have to plan and set aside an amount to save for the month. 🏦 You will have to key in this amount under <b>Update > Monthly Savings</b>. This amount cannot be changed so as to encourage you to make careful planning before keying in. 📝
          If you happen to receive extra money in the middle of the month that you wish to save, you will then update it under <b>Update > Bonus Savings</b>. 🥳
          To check your saving records for the current month, go to <b>My Records > Current Month</b>. Go to <b> My Records > History</b> to view the total savings that you have accumulated over the months and you can monitor your average monthly savings. 📈

        <h3 id="spendings">Manage Spendings</h3>
        <p>
          At the start of each month, you will have to plan and set a monthly budget. 🏦 You will have to key in this amount under <b>Update > Monthly Budget</b>. This amount cannot be changed so as to encourage you to make careful planning before keying in. 📝
          Whenever you spend, you should update the amount under <b>Update > Daily Expenditure > Category that You Spent On</b> so as to better track your spendings. You will be warned when your expenditure hits a dangerous zone of 90% of your monthly budget when you continue to spend. (<i>orhor</i>) 💸 This serves to remind you to start limiting your expenditure if possible.
          Not sure how to plan your budget for the new month?🤔Head on to <b>Update > Advice</b> to get suggestions from our bot on your predicted monthly expenditure. However, this feature is only available <i>6 months</i> after you start using the bot as the bot provides suggestions based on your past expenditure records!🗒️
          To monitor your spendings for the month, go to <b>My Records > Current Month</b> and you will be provided with the statistics of your spendings. 📉 A <i>very very very</i> pretty and colourful pie chart that gives a breakdown of your spending is also provided for you to monitor where your expenditure lies. 🥧
          To track your performance over the months, go to <b>My Records > History</b> and you will receive details such as number of months that you have kept within budget and average monthly expenditure. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="debts">Manage Debts</h3>
        <p>
          What's a one-stop finance management tool if you can't track your debts? 💵 This feature allows you to keep track of your debtees/ debtors and the amount you owe/ others owe you. To begin, select <b>IOU or UOMe</b> (depending on your debt flow). Then select <b>Update Debtees or Debtors</b> and manage your list of debts accordingly.
          You can add and delete debtees/debtors accordingly. If you there's more money that you want to add on to exisitng debtor/debtee, just key in the name of your debtor/debtee and the additional amount they owe you/ you owe them and we will sum it for you! To view the list, simply head on to <b>Show Debtees or Debtors</b>. 📋 We hope this feature helps you remember your cash flow better so that you will not forget to pay people back or get your money back! 😉

				<h3 id="promotions">Promotions</h3>
				<p>
          How to spend less and save more? As students ourselves (<i> not aunties hor</i>), we can't really give you solid advices, but leveraging on promotions definitely helps! 🛍️
          Telegram has a repertoire of channels that provide comprehensive, updated and vast numbers of promotions. We have curated the best promotion channels in Singapore that gives you access to many promotions in a click of the finger! 📲
          What's best? You don't have to subscribe to those channels!

				<h3 id="socialite">$ocialite</h3>
				<p>
          Who says good financial management is an individual's responsibility? Team MoneyFace believes that money management should never be a lonely fight. With this unique $ocialite feature, we hope to strengthen friendships while fattening wallets. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
          To start using this feature, you will have to share your contacts with the bot. Please be assured that the information is used solely for engagement with your friends. 
          Under $ocialite, you get to challenge your friends to spend within a reasonable amount within the month that you decide under <b>Challenge Friend</b>. Your friend will receive your challenge message and at 9pm of the first day of the new month, the results for the challenge will be made known to you and your friend! 🎉
          Have a friend that has been under your debtor list for too long but you are too paiseh to ask your friend to pay you back? Fret not. Use the <b>Remind Friend</b> feature and we help you do the dirty job and remind your friend to pay you back! 😄
          <i>Kindly note that both you and your friend must have shared your contacts with the bot for $ocialite to work.</i>

        <h3 id="reminders">Reminders</h3>
        <p>
          We also don't like to transform ourselves into naggy aunties.👵 But then sometimes we know you will forget to track your spendings and never key in your daily expenditure. That's why we have ... <i>drumroll please</i> ... <b>daily reminder at 9pm</b> to remind you to key in your spendings for the day! ⏰
          Furthermore, we also have a <b>monthly reminder</b> that will be sent on the first day of the month at 9pm which provides you with a holistic report of your finances in the previous month and remind you to plan your budget and savings in the new month. 
          What about those people who think the reminders are too annoying? 😒 You can opt out of the reminders feature under <b>Settings > Reminders > No</b></n>. 🔘 If you miss receiving a message from our bot at 9pm everyday, then go to <b>Settings > Reminders > Yes</b>.
